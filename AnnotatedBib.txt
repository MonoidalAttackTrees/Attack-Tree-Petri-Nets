In this paper, the authors define Open Petri nets as Petri nets with the addition of designated input and output places in order to study the reachability semantics of Petri nets, a way of calculating what outputs are possible given some inputs to a Petri net. They follow the work of Meseguer and Montanari in looking at Petri nets as symmetric monoids, but further develop the application of category theory to Petri nets by understanding Open Petri nets as a double category, which allows them to ???not sure exactly, need to read and think some more??? The authors' notion of an Open Petri net, with input and output places, is similar to our CNETs, though they are concerned with a different problem. We formulated CNETs to build up attack trees, whereas their concern is with reachability in a pre-existing net. Thus their work and ours is complementary; their reachability semantics is a powerful tool to analyze the CNETs we can build.

The authors take a category-theoretical approach to study concurrency in Petri net models. Making the point that Petri nets can be understood as directed graphs, they introduce a category for Petri nets generally, and also for pointed Petri nets, which have an initial marking to show the beginning of the net. They also work through the categorical product and coproduct for Petri nets, and show that Petri nets are monoids where the objects are the places and the relation is given by the transitions. Our work builds on theirs by continuing the categorical approach. We also built upon their pointed Petri net to define our CNET, which is a Petri net with both a start and end place to allow for chaining. They develop two operators for the pointed Petri net, $/oplus$ and $;$, which we further developed for our CNET operators AND and SEQ, respectively.
