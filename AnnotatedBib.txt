In this paper, the authors define Open Petri nets as Petri nets with the addition of designated input and output places in order to study the reachability semantics of Petri nets, a way of calculating what outputs are possible given some inputs to a Petri net. They follow the work of Meseguer and Montanari in looking at Petri nets as symmetric monoids, but further develop the application of category theory to Petri nets by understanding Open Petri nets as a double category, which allows them to ???not sure exactly, need to read and think some more??? The authors' notion of an Open Petri net, with input and output places, is similar to our CNETs, though they are concerned with a different problem. We formulated CNETs to build up attack trees, whereas their concern is with reachability in a pre-existing net. Thus their work and ours is complementary; their reachability semantics is a powerful tool to analyze the CNETs we can build.
