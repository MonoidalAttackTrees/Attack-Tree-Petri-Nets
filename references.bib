abstract="It is a well-known fact that for every k-safe Petri net, i.e. a Petri net in which no place contains more than k ∈ ℕ tokens under any reachable marking, there is a 1-safe Petri net with the same interleaving behaviour. Indeed these types of Petri nets generate regular languages. In this paper, we show that this equivalence of k-safe and 1-safe Petri nets holds also for their pomset languages, a true-concurrency semantics.",

pages="175--189",
abstract="IDEA OF STARTING PLACE AND ENDING TRANSITION We exploit a notion of interface for Petri nets in order to design a set of net combinators. For such a calculus of nets, we focus on the behavioural congruences arising from four simple notions of behaviour, viz., traces, maximal traces, step, and maximal step traces, and from the corresponding four notions of bisimulation, viz., weak and weak step bisimulation and their maximal versions. We characterize such congruences via universal contexts and via games, providing in such a way an understanding of their discerning powers.",
